# Laptop Cooling pad V2
Laptops being a powerful machine in a portable package is quite prone to overheating which may reduce the overall lifespan of the device in the long run. In order to tackle this problem many companies developed solutions like cooling pads to provide extra ventilation for air flow, but lacks many features and are expensive when compared to their value. 
##  Solution 
In order to tackle this problem I designed a new form of cooling pad using cardboard which provides additional airflow by pushing air through laptops inlets, dropping temperature by about 10 degrees. The fans used are salvaged from old discarded servers 
and are controlled using PWM supplied by an esp8266. The cooling pad consists of a mini OLED display which is capable of showing time and shows RPM of the fans spinning.
